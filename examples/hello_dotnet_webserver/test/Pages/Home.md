## Home

This is the index of your website, rendered [with Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

The template is intended mainly for static websites such as the website
of a restaurant or some other business. If you would like to serve
dynamic content (e.g. fetched from a database) the [MVC pattern](https://genhttp.org/documentation/content/controllers)
will probably suit your needs better.

Typically, you will use elements defined by [your theme](https://github.com/Kaliumhexacyanoferrat/GenHTTP.Themes)
for a native look and feel. This website currently uses the 
[Lorahost theme](https://colorlib.com/wp/template/lorahost/).
