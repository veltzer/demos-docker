# Java build in docker

In this exercise you will build a java application in docker and create an image of it
in another docker.

Both docker images will be created from the *same docker file*.

Do the building using either maven or gradle (choose one).

See [this](https://github.com/veltzer/demos-docker/tree/master/examples/hello_dotnet_webserver) as an example of how to do this in .net.
