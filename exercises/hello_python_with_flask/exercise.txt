- build a webserver in docker built on python + flask.
	* you can find examples like these all over the web
	* you will also need to make sure the flask module is installed.
- use port 8080 since that's the only port that is opened for the machine
	you have on AWS. (this doesnt matter if you are not exercising on AWS).
- you will need to make sure your port 8080 is open and exposed to the outside
	work.
	* hint: docker run --network
- access you webserver via:
	http://[your_ip]:8080/
