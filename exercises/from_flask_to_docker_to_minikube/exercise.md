Phase 1
=======
- create a flask application with the following UI:
	upload a file [_______________]V
 	where the user can upload a file.
	This page will appear in http://localhost/upload
- make the "server" side of the application save the uploaded file to a predefined directory.
- add a page that lists all the files that you currently have in storage
	This page will appear in http://localhost/list
	When starting the list, of course, should be empty.

Phase 2
=======
- Wrap your application as docker image (prepare Dockerfile, build etc...)
- Run your application with a volume (--volume) and make your application write to that
	volume so that after you kill the app the files uploaded are still there.
- Upload some files, kill the docker container and see that the files are still there.
	(in order to demonstrate that your solution is fine...)


Phase 3
=======
- Install minikube on your linux machine.
	It must be a real linux machine with enough RAM (at least 4 gig but maybe more).
	It must not be a WSL type windows system.

	https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start
- Run minikube.
- Create a deployment file for your container (app.yaml) and deploy your newly created app.
	At first do it simply with no stateful storage.
	relicas = 1 in our case (we don't need replicas for this exercise)
- Second stage: add stateful storage to the k8s installation.
