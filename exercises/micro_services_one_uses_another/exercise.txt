Create a micro-service type solution using docker

Micro service A will be exposed to the outside world using port 8080
(8080 is open in your AWS machines)
When going to url "index.html" in micro service A you will be presented with a web page
with the following content:
		Enter a: ____7____
		Enter b: ____5____
		CalculateButton
use an HTML form for this.
When pressing the button Micro service A will receive the value for a and b
and create a request for Micro service B which will respond with the sum
of a and b.
The micro service A will show a weg page of the following format:
		The result is: 12
Micro service B will run on port 8081 (not to confuse anyone).
It will have only one url: add
So when I do:
	wget "localhost:8081/add?a=5&b=7"
I will get reh result (12)

Dependencies
============
Both web services will be writtein in python with the "flask" framwork.
So make sure you install the "flask" package in both micro-services.

In order for service A to access service B you will need to issue an HTTP
request from A to B. You will do this using the "requests" python library.
Make sure you have it in your docker image A using "pip install requests"

Advice
======
Work slowly! First do only service B and test it on it's own.
Only then add service A.
