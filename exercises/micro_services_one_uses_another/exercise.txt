	Create a micro-service type solution using docker

	Micro service A will be exposed to the outside world using port 8080
	(8080 is open in your AWS machines)
	When going to url "index.html" in micro service A you will be presented with a web page
	with the following content:
			Enter a: ____7____
			Enter b: ____5____
			CalculateButton
	use an HTML form for this.
	When pressing the button Micro service A will receive the value for a and b
	and create a request for Micro service B which will respond with the sum
	of a and b.
	The micro service A will show a weg page of the following format:
			The result is: 12
	Micro service B will run on port 8081 (not to confuse anyone).
	It will have only one url: add
	So when I do:
		wget localhost:8081/add?a=5;b=7
	I will get reh result (12)

	Both web services will be writtein in python with the flask framwork.
	In order for service A to access service B you will need to issue an HTTP
	request from A to B. You will do this using the "requests" python library.
	Make sure you have it in your docker image using "pip install requests"

	Work slowly! First do only service B and test it on it's own.
	Only then add service A.
