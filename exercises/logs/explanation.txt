When you run a containerized app (python or not) its standard output is not flushed on every print, unlike
when you run it regularly on a terminal.

If you want to see your logs live you need to fix your app so that it flushed.
In python there are two ways to do it:
- fix it so the output will be flushed on newlines (sys.stdout.line_buffering=True)
- flush on every print (sys.stdout.flush())
