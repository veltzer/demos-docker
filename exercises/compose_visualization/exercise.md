# Create visualization solution using Prometheus and Grafana

* You will need to run two docker containers: one for Prometheus and one for Grafana.

* You will need to connect them together since Grafana will need access to Promethus data.

* Insert some data into Prometheus.

* Create a graph in Grafana to show the data from Prometheus.
