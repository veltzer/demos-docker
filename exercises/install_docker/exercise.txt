Install docker in ubuntu:
	You need have an ubuntu virtual machine.
	Install the following packages:
		docker.io
		containerd	
	Install them with:
		$ sudo apt install docker.io containerd
	After the installation you can see them running with:
		$ ps -ef | grep dockerd
		$ ps -ef | grep containerd

Adding yourself to the docker group:
	Check if you are in the docker group using the command:
	 	$ groups
	If you are in the docker group go to the next phase exercise
	If you are not in the docker then:
	- add yourself to the docker group using the command:
		$ sudo /usr/sbin/adduser [your_user_name] docker
	- logout and re-login (in windows virtualization you may need to
		restart the vm guest)
	- run:
		$ groups
	to check that now you are in the "docker" group.

Lets run some containers...
Make sure you don't have anything listening on port 80:
	$ netstat -lp | grep http
	$ docker run --network host nginx
and now check that you can talk to the nginx that you just installed by pointing
you browser to:
	localhost:80

* if you dont have 'netstat' then install the 'net-tools' package.
