- Add a small python container that runs in a loop and writes some data to the data folder.
- Use data volumes to make sure that the application writes to a data volume which are
	simply folders on the hose operating system.
	(data volumes are achieved using the --volume command line argument to "docker run")
- Run the docker container for 20 seconds.
- Kill the container.
- Check the data volume to see that you have data from 20 seconds of operation.
