the problems:
- software depenency
	How do we make sure that if a software A depends on components N1, N2, ..., Nk
	those components and not others will be available at runtime
- software installation
	How do we make sure that installing software does not expose my computer to malware,
	spyware, viruses, etc. That software installation do not cause harm to other
	pieces of software which are already installed on my computer and do not cause
	harm to the Operating system itself.
- software isolation
	How do I make sure that software that I install only has access to data which I want
	it to have and not to any data no my computer.

The Windows way
- software provider provides not only the software but all dependencies as well.
- software can do whatever it wants during installation and runs as administrator.

advantages:
- software always has the dependencies it needs
- you can do whatever you want - even overwrite some parts of the OS

disadvantages:
- big installations, big disk requirements, big memory requirements, long installation time
- really bad security
- no updates built in unless you have your own update mechanism.
- no software installation system. any software vendor does anything he likes on my computer.
- pieces of software fighting each other over dominance of your computer.
