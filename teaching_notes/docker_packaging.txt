	Stages in creating a docker image:

	1. Create a folder where you will put all the ingredients for the new docker image.
	2. Put all the software that you want to package in that folder (and only what you
		need, nothing more!).
	3. Create a file called 'Dockerfile' (you can call it by another name but try to
		stick to the convention).
		This Dockerfile will have the instructions about how to create the docker
		image.
		This file has language of its own.
	4. Run (from the folder you created):
		$ docker build --tag [your_tag_name]:[your_version] .
		* the "." at the end is important, it is the directory used to build
		the docker image.
	5. if the build in (4) passed then the newly created image is available locally
		and you can see it with:
		$ docker images

	Why docker images should have everything they need to run and NOTHING MORE!
	1. Performance - we want to run this docker image and so want it to be as small
		as possible so as not to take too many resources.
	2. Security - the smaller the docker image is the less of an "attack surface" it has.
