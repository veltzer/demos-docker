		$ ssh -i key.pem ubuntu@[ip]
	for example:
		$ ssh -i key.pem ubuntu@3.123.6.158

		$ chmod 400 key.pem


	For people on windows:
		There are lots of tools to use ssh.
		If you know and love a tool, use it.

		If you don't have any idea what I'm talking about I recommend either
		"putty" or "moba xterm".
		Download whatever seems nicer to you.
		If you have "Linux for windows" you do what normal people do (see above).
		For newbies I recommend "moba xterm"
