- write the code in a file called [filename]
- now you can run it with:
	$ python3 [filename]
- if you want the script to be executable, this means that
	you will be able to run it on its own then:
	1) Add a first line of the form:
		#!/usr/bin/python3
	2) Change the script to be executable using:
		$ chmod +x [filename]

* you can, if you want, to call python files with a .py extension
	BUT THIS IS NOT MANDATORY.
	You can call script ANY WAY YOU LIKE.
	People call python script with .py ONLY to remind themselves that this
	is a python script, NOT because of some techical requirement.
